After precision and sharding have been chosen, each GPU sees a specific set of
local tensor shapes and matrix multiplications. The remaining question is how
those local computations are executed.

This chapter examines three optimizations that change that execution path.
Rematerialization trades memory for additional computation. Fused attention
avoids materializing large intermediate tensors in HBM. Sparse MoE kernels
replace padded expert computation with data-dependent grouped execution when
the software stack supports it.

The HLO figures are pruned from literal outputs and rendered with Graphviz.
Those fixtures were compiled on `gfx950` with JAX and `jaxlib` 0.11.0,
ROCm plugin and PJRT 0.11.0.post1, and Transformer Engine
2.17.0+6aa471b18. The cited MaxText model files match commit
[`b47d74bf`](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/tree/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe).
Case-study tables state their own, sometimes older, provenance.

## Rematerialization and checkpointing

### Activations in training memory

A training step keeps parameters and optimizer state across updates.
Activations are temporary, but they are often the largest temporary objects in
a training step. Many forward-pass values must remain available until the
backward pass reaches the operation that produced them. With \(L\) layers and
rematerialization policy \(p\), a useful local activation ledger is

$$
M_{\mathrm{saved,local}}(p)
=
\sum_{\ell=1}^{L}
\sum_{r\in\mathcal R_\ell(p)}
\frac{|r|\,w_r}{s_r}
+M_{\mathrm{loss}}+M_{\mathrm{backend}}+M_{\mathrm{workspace}},
$$

where \(\mathcal R_\ell(p)\) is the set of residuals saved for layer \(\ell\),
\(w_r\) is bytes per element, and \(s_r\) is the product of mesh axes that shard
that value. This expression accounts for bytes that must be preserved, but it
does not directly predict peak memory usage. XLA can alias buffers and schedule
temporaries with disjoint lifetimes, while a fused library call can allocate a
workspace outside the visible JAX expression.

For the Llama 7B policy used below, the named BF16 residuals are Q, K, V,
attention context, attention output, two MLP up projections, and the MLP down
projection. With local batch \(B_\ell\), sequence \(S\), model width \(D\), and
MLP width \(F\),

$$
M_{\mathrm{named}}
=L B_\ell S w_{\mathrm{BF16}}(6D+2F).
$$

At \(L=32\), \(B_\ell=4\), \(S=4096\), \(D=4096\), and \(F=11008\), this is
45.5 GiB per GPU. This estimate captures only the explicitly listed residuals.
Other values, such as layer inputs, normalization statistics, logits, compiler
temporaries, and backend workspaces, contribute additional memory.

### What reverse-mode AD stores

Understanding rematerialization requires understanding what reverse-mode AD
actually saves.

The forward pass is executed first. During that pass, JAX preserves only the
values required by the backward rules of later operations. Each primitive's
transpose rule determines which primal values it needs. A matrix product needs
the opposite operand to form each gradient. The derivative of `tanh` can use
its output. Softmax backward uses its probabilities, or enough state to
reconstruct them. JAX calls these saved values *residuals* in its
[`jax.checkpoint` documentation](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/gradient-checkpointing.html).

Importantly, this saved state is usually much smaller than the complete forward
computation. Constants and values available as function arguments need not be
copied. Dead values are removed. Fusion can keep a short-lived value in
registers or LDS. A custom VJP also defines its own contract: fused attention
commonly returns row log-sum-exp and RNG state for backward instead of the
complete probability matrix.

### What is rematerialization

Rematerialization changes the storage-versus-recomputation tradeoff.

Instead of retaining every residual required by the backward pass, the system
chooses selected checkpoint boundaries and reconstructs missing values when
they are needed later. The method was developed for deep networks by
[Chen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174); the
[JAX Scaling Book derivation](https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/transformers/#gradient-checkpointing)
relates the same trade to Transformer layers.

Let \(\mathcal C(p)\) be operations replayed under policy \(p\), and let \(m_i\)
be the number of replays of operation \(i\). Then

$$
F_{\mathrm{executed}}(p)
=F_{\mathrm{ordinary\ step}}
+\sum_{i\in\mathcal C(p)}m_iF_i.
$$

Only operations inside the rematerialized region contribute replayed work. A
policy that saves dot outputs may replay only normalization and pointwise work.
Full layer remat can replay the projections and attention forward path.

The same rule applies to communication. A collective outside the checkpointed
region executes once. A collective inside the region may be replayed during
reconstruction.

{% include figure.liquid path="pages/img/pg6/ch6-remat-saved-vs-recomputed.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Three forward and backward dataflows showing all residuals saved, named residuals saved, and only a layer input saved with the omitted forward work replayed" caption="The policy controls what crosses the autodiff boundary. Sharding changes the bytes represented by each checkpoint; the operations inside the rematerialized region determine replayed FLOPs and communication." %}

### Implementing in JAX

[`jax.checkpoint`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.checkpoint.html)
and `jax.remat` are aliases. At a high level, a checkpoint policy answers a
simple question for each operation:

> May this value be saved, or must it be recomputed later?

Policies receive type-level primitive descriptions. Named policies use
[`checkpoint_name`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.ad_checkpoint.checkpoint_name.html),
which is an identity at execution time and a label in the trace:

```python
from jax.ad_checkpoint import checkpoint_name

def decoder_layer(x, weights):
    q = checkpoint_name(project_q(x, weights.q), "query_proj")
    context = checkpoint_name(attend(q, weights), "context")
    mlp = checkpoint_name(project_up(x, weights.up), "mlpwi_0")
    return combine(context, mlp)

policy = jax.checkpoint_policies.save_only_these_names(
    "query_proj", "context", "mlpwi_0"
)
checkpointed_layer = jax.checkpoint(decoder_layer, policy=policy)
```

The main policy constructors are:

| Policy | Saved residuals |
|---|---|
| `everything_saveable` | Every residual that ordinary AD elects to keep |
| `nothing_saveable` or `policy=None` inside `jax.checkpoint` | Inputs to the remat boundary; internal values replay |
| `dots_saveable` and related dot policies | Dot outputs that satisfy the policy predicate |
| `save_only_these_names(...)` | Values carrying one of the listed names |
| `save_and_offload_only_these_names(...)` | Listed values kept on device or moved to another memory space |

A common source of confusion is that `policy=None` does not disable
rematerialization once a function has already been wrapped in `jax.checkpoint`.
To disable explicit remat, call the original function. This distinction matters
in framework dispatch code, where a config value first decides whether to wrap
a layer and then selects the policy passed to that wrapper.

Use
[`jax.ad_checkpoint.print_saved_residuals`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/gradient-checkpointing.html#examining-which-activations-are-stored)
on a small shape before compiling the full model. It shows the AD decision before XLA
fusion and buffer assignment. The optimized HLO and `compiled.memory_analysis()` are
still required for the device-memory result.

### MaxText policy surface

MaxText sets `checkpoint_name` on projections and context, resolves
`remat_policy`, and applies the resulting policy to the decoder layer. The current
definitions are in
[`Decoder.get_remat_policy`](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/decoders.py#L325-L433)
and the equivalent
[NNX policy builder](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/nnx_decoders.py#L1111-L1218).
The NNX decoder explicitly calls the pure layer when
[`remat_policy == "none"`](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/nnx_decoders.py#L1865-L1868).

| MaxText value | Named values retained by the preset |
|---|---|
| `minimal_with_context` | Q/K/V or fused QKV, output projection, context, MLP up and down projections |
| `minimal` | The same projection classes without context |
| `save_dot_with_context_except_mlp` | Attention projections, output projection, and context |
| `save_qkv_proj` | Q/K/V or fused QKV projections |
| `full` | No internal values allowed by the default checkpoint policy |
| `custom` | Per-name `device`, `remat`, or `offload` assignments |

The policy names are only meaningful if they match the names actually produced
by the model implementation. MaxText's
[`minimal_with_context` list](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/decoders.py#L325-L343)
contains names for separate Q/K/V, fused QKV, and gated MLP variants for this reason.
A low-precision backend can add packed weights, scales, or quantization history that
a BF16 policy never considered.

### Changes at the HLO level

The following figure uses a real two-layer BF16 fixture. Without explicit remat,
`%tanh.3` feeds the backward `%sub.3` directly. Full remat carries
`%remat2.10` through `%remat2.11`, then
reconstructs the missing value with `%dot_general.9` and `%tanh.6`; both carry
`checkpoint/rematted_computation` in their literal metadata.

{% include figure.liquid path="pages/img/pg6/ch6-hlo-remat-none-full.svg" class="img-fluid" zoomable=true alt="Pruned literal HLO comparison in which no remat reuses tanh.3 and full remat reconstructs it with dot_general.9 and tanh.6" caption="Real JAX 0.11 `before_optimizations` HLO rendered with Graphviz. Exact operation names and shapes are retained; layout-only and unrelated gradient nodes are pruned." %}

The appearance of additional HLO operations does not, by itself, prove that
memory has been reduced. The useful checks are a smaller forward-to-backward
residual tuple, reconstructed work in the backward body, and a shorter peak
live range in the buffer assignment. XLA's own compiler rematerialization may
also replay operations for scheduling reasons; that is separate from the
explicit JAX policy.

### Sharding and collectives

Sharding affects checkpoint size only when it reduces the local shape of a
saved tensor. If a global activation is \([B,S,D]\) and its batch and hidden
axes are sharded by \(p_B\) and \(p_D\), its local storage is

$$
M_{\mathrm{local}}=\frac{BSDw}{p_Bp_D}.
$$

Replicated sequence or hidden dimensions contribute no divisor. The Llama comparison
below keeps four sequences per GPU while increasing global batch from 4 to 32 under
FSDP-8, so its local named-activation estimate remains 45.5 GiB. FSDP greatly reduces
the local parameter and optimizer state, but weak scaling does not reduce the local
batch activations.

A collective is replayed only when it lies inside the rematerialized computation.
For example, an FSDP weight AllGather performed before a checkpoint boundary can feed
both forward and backward without being rematerialized. A gather inside a
checkpointed layer can execute again when that layer is reconstructed.

The retained FSDP-8 scheduled HLO makes that distinction visible. All three policies
contain eight static collective-start instructions and 1.076 GiB of summed result
shapes. `minimal_with_context` and `full` each place one AllGather under
`checkpoint/rematted_computation`; `none` places none there. The identical
static counts do not prove that additional communication occurred at runtime.
They show that the remat boundary contains a collective in this implementation,
so dynamic execution must be counted from the loop structure or a device trace.

### Case study: Llama 7B

The matched model has 6.738 billion parameters, 32 scanned layers, width 4096, MLP
width 11008, 32 heads of width 128, sequence 4096, and local batch 4. Compute is BF16;
parameters, gradients, and Adam moments are FP32. Transformer Engine attention is
pinned to the CK/AITER route. Every run uses 30 synchronized steps on MI355X, and the
table reports steps 10–29. The memory logger divides by \(2^{30}\), so its historical
`GB` field is GiB.

The one-GPU cohort was captured on 16 September 2026 with JAX 0.11.0, ROCm
plugin/PJRT 0.11.0.post1, ROCm 7.14, and local Llama source commit
`5f996a88`.
The FSDP-8 cohort was captured on 11 September with JAX 0.11.0 and ROCm 7.14 using
the same raw-JAX model and an eight-device `fsdp` mesh.

| Scope | Policy | Median step | Std. dev. | Tokens/s/GPU | Compiled memory | Allocator peak |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 GPU | `none` | 0.745 s | 0.0010 s | 21,992 | 247.6 GiB | 247.56 GiB |
| 1 GPU | `minimal_with_context` | 0.676 s | 0.0013 s | 24,237 | 152.9 GiB | 152.88 GiB |
| 1 GPU | `full` | 0.794 s | 0.0020 s | 20,635 | 106.6 GiB | 106.62 GiB |
| FSDP-8 | `none` | 0.763 s | 0.0006 s | 21,473 | 150.5 GiB | 150.49 GiB |
| FSDP-8 | `minimal_with_context` | 0.740 s | 0.0020 s | 22,141 | 66.9 GiB | 66.86 GiB |
| FSDP-8 | `full` | 0.864 s | 0.0037 s | 18,963 | 21.1 GiB | 21.14 GiB |

Among the evaluated policies, `minimal_with_context` provides the best tradeoff
between memory consumption and throughput. It is faster than `none` while using
much less memory. On one GPU it removes 94.7 GiB from the compiled plan and
improves median step time by 9.3%. Under FSDP-8 it removes 83.6 GiB and
improves time by 3.0%. The results illustrate that retaining more activations
is not automatically faster. Additional saved state increases memory traffic
and can restrict scheduling flexibility.

The predicted 45.5 GiB named-residual term can be checked directly. Moving from
`minimal_with_context` to `full` removes 46.3 GiB on one GPU and 45.8 GiB under
FSDP-8. The close match validates the scale of the estimate; the remaining fraction
belongs to alignment and other changed live ranges.

For full remat, the large decoder operations replayed in one forward layer stack are
approximately

$$
F_{\mathrm{replay,full}}
=212.21\ \text{TFLOP}_{\mathrm{projections}}
+17.59\ \text{TFLOP}_{\mathrm{attention}}
=229.80\ \text{TFLOP}.
$$

That is 32.7% of the ordinary 702.28-TFLOP model ledger, before pointwise work.
Measured median time rises by 17.5% from minimal to full on one GPU and 16.8% under
FSDP-8. A separate one-layer PMC capture confirms the direction: the profiler's BF16
MFMA operation count is 35.031 TFLOP for `none`, 35.340 for minimal, and 38.072 for
full. The one-layer step includes the vocabulary head, so its 8.7% full-versus-none
counter increase is not the 32-layer analytical ratio.

The FSDP rows are weak scaling: local tokens stay at 16,384 while global batch grows
to 32 sequences. They show that the remat choice must be retested after sharding.
The smaller state leaves far more HBM headroom, while AllGather and ReduceScatter
raise the cost of the full policy.

## Attention backend implementations

### Components of attention

Attention combines three tensors: queries, keys, and values. The forward pass
computes attention scores, normalizes them with softmax, and uses the resulting
probabilities to mix the value vectors.

$$
S=\frac{QK^\mathsf T}{\sqrt d}+M,\qquad
P=\operatorname{softmax}(S),\qquad
O=PV,
$$

where \(M\) contains the causal or padding mask. Backward has two matrix paths:

$$
\begin{aligned}
dV &= P^\mathsf T dO, &
dP &= dO\,V^\mathsf T,\\
dS &= P\odot\left(dP-\operatorname{rowsum}(dP\odot P)\right),\\
dQ &= dS\,K, &
dK &= dS^\mathsf TQ.
\end{aligned}
$$

A backend must implement the requested mask, layout, dtype, dropout, and sharding in
both directions. A fast forward kernel with no correct VJP is an inference path.
The backward equations also show why a training backend needs Q, K, V, and
softmax information even when the forward API returns only O.

### Forward and backward working sets

The key systems difference between standard attention and FlashAttention is
memory.

A conventional implementation materializes score-like tensors whose size
scales with both query length and key length. If \(c\) score or probability
arrays are live, its HBM term is approximately

$$
M_{\mathrm{standard}}
\approx c\,B_\ell H_\ell S_qS_k w_s.
$$

For the Llama shape \([B,H,S,S]=[4,32,4096,4096]\), one FP32 score tensor is
8 GiB. The XLA path can have masked logits, exponentials, and normalized
probabilities with overlapping lifetimes.

[FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135) tiles Q, K, and V, maintains an
online softmax, and avoids writing the complete \(S_qS_k\) matrix to HBM. A simple
on-chip working-set model for one tile is

$$
M_{\mathrm{tile}}
\approx w\left[(B_q+2B_k)d+B_qB_k+B_qd_v\right],
$$

plus \(O(BHS)\) row statistics in HBM. The exact tile, staging depth, and accumulator
layout are backend decisions. [FlashAttention-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691)
also changes work partitioning to improve occupancy and parallelism.

{% include figure.liquid path="pages/img/pg6/flashattention-figure1.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="FlashAttention Figure 1 showing tiled movement between GPU HBM and on-chip SRAM together with the paper's GPT-2 attention speedup" caption="Figure 1 from <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135'>FlashAttention</a>. The left panel shows the relevant mechanism: Q, K, and V tiles move through on-chip SRAM without materializing the full attention matrix in HBM. The right panel is the paper's A100 result and is not an MI355X measurement." %}

Backward attention should be considered a separate implementation problem
rather than a consequence of forward performance. It may reconstruct scores
from Q, K, the output, and row log-sum-exp; calculate \(dQ\) separately from
\(dK,dV\); use atomics; and launch conversion or reduction helpers. Forward
timing or a forward-only HLO fixture cannot predict those costs.

### ROCm attention backends

From the user's perspective, MaxText exposes several attention implementations
that produce the same mathematical result through different execution paths.
The corresponding standard, TE, and Pallas selection is in
[`AttentionOp.apply_attention`](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/attention_op.py#L1030-L1175).

| Route | Forward implementation | Backward ownership | What HLO reveals |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard XLA | QK dot, mask, reductions, exponential, normalization, PV dot | JAX transposes the exposed primitives; XLA selects kernels for the resulting graph | Algorithm and tensors remain visible |
| Transformer Engine | `DotProductAttention`, selected in MaxText by `attention=cudnn_flash_te` | TE custom VJP and `te_fused_attn_backward_ffi` | Typed FFI boundary, outputs, layouts, attributes, and workspace contract |
| Direct JAX-AITER | `jax_aiter.mha.flash_attn_func` | JAX-AITER custom VJP; unified forward and backward FFI handlers | `MhaFwdUnifiedJA` and `MhaBwdUnifiedJA` boundaries |
| Tokamax Pallas–Triton | Pallas flash-attention program compiled through Triton | Pallas forward-residual and VJP kernels | Generated fusions and kernel metadata rather than an external library call |

`cudnn_flash_te` is a compatibility name in MaxText; it enters
[Transformer Engine's JAX module](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/attention_op.py#L1730-L1850).
On ROCm, TE filters the problem by dtype, shape, QKV layout, mask, dropout, and head
dimensions, then selects an enabled backend. The
[ROCm Transformer Engine source](https://github.com/ROCm/TransformerEngine/blob/dev/README.rst)
documents CK and AOTriton, with CK taking priority when both match. The experiment
sets `NVTE_FUSED_ATTN_CK=1` and `NVTE_FUSED_ATTN_AOTRITON=0`.

Direct [JAX-AITER](https://github.com/ROCm/jax-aiter) bypasses Transformer
Engine's backend selection layer and invokes the JAX-AITER implementation
directly. The pinned source at
[`35b7175c`](https://github.com/ROCm/jax-aiter/tree/35b7175c763153ddb5da50c47d33dec436d5f191)
registers one FFI target per direction and supplies custom partitioning plus a custom
VJP. AITER still chooses CK or ASM internally from the concrete problem.

The Pallas route is the only one whose flash algorithm is expressed as a JAX kernel
program. Current MaxText uses `attention=flash` on GPU to construct
`PallasTritonFlashAttention`. The Llama experiment pins Tokamax 0.0.14, supplies an
explicit BF16 dot algorithm, and adjusts Tokamax's GPU capability guard for `gfx950`.
Its result therefore belongs to that wrapper and version, not to every Pallas/Triton
configuration.

### Changes at the HLO level

In standard attention, the compiler can see the score computation, masking
operations, softmax reductions, and value-mixing output explicitly.

The matched forward fixtures use BF16 Q, K, and V shaped `[1,128,8,64]`.
Their HLO contains `%dot_general.2`, the causal selection, FP32
`%reduce_max.7`, `%exp.1`, `%reduce_sum.7`, `%div.7`, and the final
`%dot_general.3`.

{% include figure.liquid path="pages/img/pg6/ch6-hlo-attention-xla.svg" class="img-fluid" zoomable=true alt="Literal pruned XLA HLO graph for standard JAX attention showing QK dot mask softmax reductions and PV dot" caption="Real JAX 0.11 `before_optimizations` HLO. The score path is visible as ordinary HLO and uses FP32 for the softmax-shaped tensors." %}

Transformer Engine instead produces
`custom_call_target="te_fused_attn_forward_ffi"`. Its tuple contains the BF16 output,
FP32 row state, RNG state, and a byte result before `%te_fused_attn_forward_ffi.6`
extracts the output.

{% include figure.liquid path="pages/img/pg6/ch6-hlo-attention-te.svg" class="img-fluid" zoomable=true alt="Literal pruned HLO graph for Transformer Engine attention with Q K V and metadata entering te_fused_attn_forward_ffi" caption="Real JAX 0.11 `before_optimizations` HLO. The graph shows the TE typed-FFI boundary and its result contract; kernel internals remain outside HLO." %}

These graphs describe only the forward computation visible to HLO. The TE
source defines the separate
[`te_fused_attn_backward_ffi`](https://github.com/ROCm/TransformerEngine/blob/dev/transformer_engine/jax/cpp_extensions/attention.py);
the full training trace below establishes the kernels selected behind both
directions. This is the
[OpenXLA custom-call boundary](https://openxla.org/xla/custom_call): HLO describes
the external operation, while the host handler enqueues work on the ROCm stream.

### Observed kernel geometry

The one-layer capture uses the production attention shape: BF16, batch 4, sequence
4096, 32 heads, and head dimension 128. The trace records grid, workgroup, LDS,
regular VGPR, and accumulator VGPR fields. It does not report a universal attention
tile, so the figure preserves those fields rather than inferring \(B_q\) and \(B_k\).

{% include figure.liquid path="pages/img/pg6/ch6-attention-observed-kernels.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Three columns of literal rocprof kernel names and launch metadata for Transformer Engine direct JAX-AITER and Pallas-Triton forward and backward attention" caption="Observed launch geometry from the 10 September one-layer PMC campaign. Transformer Engine and direct JAX-AITER reach the same named forward kernel and geometry, then use different backward kernels. The fields are literal CSV values." %}

Both TE and direct JAX-AITER launch
`aiter::fmha_fwd_hd128_bf16_causal` with grid `4096×32×4`, a 512-thread
workgroup, 160 KiB LDS, 32 VGPRs, and 224 accumulator VGPRs. At this shape, the
observed forward kernel is identical across the Transformer Engine and direct
JAX-AITER paths.

The forward kernels converge, but the backward implementations diverge. TE
launches the named AITER O-gradient helper,
`...bf16_causal_a32_psskddv`, and dQ conversion kernels. Direct JAX-AITER launches
CK Tile classes including `FmhaBwdOGradDotOKernel`,
`FmhaBwdDQDKDVKernel`, and `FmhaBwdConvertQGradKernel`. Pallas launches
`pallas_flash_attention_fwd_res` and `pallas_flash_attention_vjp`. The resource
fields show substantial register and LDS pressure, but this campaign did not collect
the level counters needed to calculate achieved occupancy. Chapter 1's occupancy
formula should not be applied to these fields as though it were a measured value.

### Case study: Llama 7B

The retained clean timing comparison comes from
`docker.io/rocm/jax-training:maxtext-v26.5` with JAX 0.10.0 on one MI355X.
Both rows use the raw-JAX Llama model, BF16, sequence 4096, batch 4,
`minimal_with_context`, 30 synchronized steps, and the same XLA flags. The table uses
steps 10–29.

| Attention route | Median step | Tokens/s/GPU | Compiled memory | Allocator peak |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Standard XLA | 1.498 s | 10,934 | 167.1 GiB | 167.07 GiB |
| Transformer Engine CK/AITER | 0.662 s | 24,758 | 152.1 GiB | 152.09 GiB |

For this complete training step, Transformer Engine delivers both higher
throughput and lower peak memory usage. Median step time falls from 1.498 s to
0.662 s, a 2.26× speedup, while peak memory falls by 15.0 GiB.

The magnitude of the speedup exceeds attention's share of model FLOPs because
FLOP counts alone do not describe execution time. They omit score traffic,
softmax work, launches, and backend efficiency.

The 10 September JAX 0.11 PMC campaign ran one production-shaped layer and selected
one warmed training step. Each counter group ran in a fresh process. The totals below
cover the complete one-layer step, not only the attention kernels.

| Route | BF16 MFMA operations | HBM fetch | HBM write | L2 hit rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Standard XLA | 36.377 TFLOP | 135.354 GiB | 49.304 GiB | 61.68% |
| Transformer Engine | 35.179 TFLOP | 79.426 GiB | 19.966 GiB | 69.59% |
| Direct JAX-AITER | 35.147 TFLOP | 81.047 GiB | 20.825 GiB | 69.77% |
| Pallas–Triton | 37.742 TFLOP | 96.315 GiB | 17.641 GiB | 68.46% |

The installed gfx950 counter definitions give the formulas:

$$

F_{\mathrm{MFMA,BF16}}

$$

The [ROCprofiler-SDK counter service](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/api-reference/counter_collection_services.html)
serializes dispatches for per-kernel counting. PMC timestamps and step duration are
therefore excluded from the speed table. The counters support the mechanism: all
three flash-style routes move much less HBM data than standard XLA in this matched
one-layer step. They do not supply a clean four-way runtime ranking.

## Grouped GEMM kernels for MoE

### Why MoE requires grouped GEMM

Mixture-of-Experts introduces a challenge that does not exist in dense models:
each expert receives a different number of tokens.

Let \(T\) be the number of input tokens and \(k\) the number of experts selected
per token. If expert \(e\) receives \(n_e\) rows,

$$
\sum_{e=1}^{E}n_e=Tk,
\qquad
\bar n=\frac{Tk}{E}.
$$

The \(n_e\) values depend on data and router parameters. Because the expert
workloads are uneven, a single dense batch shape cannot represent the routed
computation efficiently. Four implementation choices are useful:

1. Dense masked evaluates all \(E\) experts for every token and later selects the
   routed outputs. It performs \(E/k\) times the ideal routed expert arithmetic.
2. Fixed capacity allocates \(C\) rows per expert, pads underfull experts, and drops
   assignments beyond \(C\).
3. A ragged operation keeps the \(n_e\) values but can lower to a masked,
   dense-padded batch.
4. Grouped GEMM submits one runtime \(M=n_e\) problem per expert to one grouped
   library operation.

{% include figure.liquid path="pages/img/pg6/ch6-moe-routing-and-padding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Uneven expert assignments shown as dense masked fixed capacity ragged dense-padded and ragged grouped GEMM workloads" caption="An illustrative routed layer. Dense masked runs every expert, fixed capacity reserves equal slots, and a dense-padded ragged lowering masks padded rows. Grouped GEMM retains one runtime row count per expert; hardware tile tails still remain." %}

For a row tile \(T_M\), a padded-work upper model is

$$
\tilde n_e=\left\lceil\frac{n_e}{T_M}\right\rceil T_M,
\qquad
W_{\mathrm{pad}}
=\frac{\sum_e\tilde n_e-\sum_en_e}{\sum_en_e},
$$

and an expert GEMM with contracting width \(K\) and output width \(N\) issues

$$
F_{\mathrm{padded}}=2KN\sum_e\tilde n_e
\quad\text{instead of}\quad
F_{\mathrm{useful}}=2KN\sum_en_e.
$$

Predication can avoid some arithmetic, so this is an upper model of row-tile waste.
It still captures the utilization loss from small or empty groups. Grouped GEMM
removes fixed-capacity padding from its API contract; it cannot remove MFMA shape
tails or create enough rows for an underloaded expert.

### Router to expert and back

Conceptually, sparse MoE execution consists of four stages:

`route` → move tokens → run expert GEMMs → combine outputs.

MaxText expands these stages into five steps:

1. The router produces top-k expert indices and weights.
2. MaxText repeats each token k times, sorts by destination expert, and
   calculates `group_sizes`.
3. A ragged AllToAll sends rows to the expert owners, which sort them by local
   expert.
4. Grouped up, gate, and down GEMMs process the routed rows.
5. MaxText reverses the local sort and AllToAll, restores token order, and
   combines each token's k outputs with the router weights.

The current
[`RoutedMoE.sparse_matmul`](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/moe.py#L1389-L1571)
constructs the local GMM function. Routing repeats and sorts assignments, then obtains
group sizes with
[`jnp.bincount`](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/moe.py#L935-L947).
With expert parallelism, the dispatch and return use
[`jax.lax.ragged_all_to_all`](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/moe.py#L1720-L1818).

The handoff inside the layer is concise:

```python
x, routing, route_metadata = route(x, logits, pre_bias_logits, rngs)
gmm_fn = get_gmm_for_local_experts(x, routing, route_metadata)
output0, output1 = gmm_up(x, w0, w1, w0_bias, w1_bias, gmm_fn, weight_gather)
intermediate = apply_ffn_activation(output0, output1)
expert_output = gmm_fn(intermediate, wo, tiling=wo_tile_size, ...)
output = unpermute(expert_output, routing.sorted_selected_experts, routing.weights, ...)
```

This comes from the current
[route–GMM–combine body](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/moe.py#L2124-L2239).
The sparse algorithm includes sorting and communication around the expert matrix
products. A grouped GEMM microbenchmark excludes most of the layer cost.

### MaxText controls

The current user-facing MaxText field is `sparse_matmul`. A noteworthy
implementation detail is that current MaxText does not expose a user-facing
`use_ragged_dot` option.

| MaxText fields | JAX-level expert path |
|---|---|
| `sparse_matmul=false`, `capacity_factor<0` | Dense masked expert contractions |
| `sparse_matmul=false`, `capacity_factor>0` | Fixed-capacity dispatch, expert, and combine contractions |
| `sparse_matmul=true`, `use_tokamax_gmm=true` | Tokamax ragged-dot implementation |
| `sparse_matmul=true`, `use_tokamax_gmm=false`, `megablox=true` | MaxText's older Megablox path |
| `sparse_matmul=true`, `use_tokamax_gmm=false`, `megablox=false` | `jax.lax.ragged_dot` |

The dispatch is visible at
[`RoutedMoE.__call__`](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/b47d74bf4ef860c6cbd0fe5e4705c362ba360dbe/src/maxtext/layers/moe.py#L3146-L3193).
The legacy config validator also sets the internal JAX option
`jax_ragged_dot_use_ragged_dot_instruction` for the last combination. That option is
not a replacement user field.

The Mixtral launchers under test use:

```yaml
sparse_matmul: true
megablox: false
use_tokamax_gmm: false
capacity_factor: -1.0
ragged_buffer_factor: -1.0
use_custom_sort_vjp: true
```

`ragged_buffer_factor=-1.0` allocates MaxText's worst-case receive buffer. It avoids
buffer-induced assignment drops, but unused buffer rows still consume memory.
`use_custom_sort_vjp=true` makes the sort backward apply the inverse permutation
instead of relying on a generic gather gradient.

### Grouped GEMM lowering paths

A common misconception is that
[`jax.lax.ragged_dot`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.ragged_dot.html)
automatically implies grouped GEMM execution.

It does not.

`ragged_dot` specifies the operation semantics. The backend remains free to
lower those semantics either to dense padded computation or to a true grouped
GEMM implementation. On this ROCm XLA build, the experiment separates two
lowerings:

```bash
# Dense-padded lowering
XLA_FLAGS="--xla_gpu_enable_cublaslt=true \
  --xla_gpu_experimental_use_ragged_dot_grouped_gemm=false"

# hipBLASLt GroupedGEMM lowering
XLA_FLAGS="--xla_gpu_enable_cublaslt=true \
  --xla_gpu_experimental_use_ragged_dot_grouped_gemm=true"
```

The `cublaslt` spelling is shared GPU-backend compatibility vocabulary. OpenXLA's
[GEMM rewriter](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/backends/gpu/transforms/gemm_rewriter.cc)
selects hipBLASLt GroupedMatmul on ROCm, and its
[ROCm BLASLt runtime](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/stream_executor/rocm/hip_blas_lt.cc)
builds the grouped plan. hipBLASLt documents the underlying
[`hipblaslt_ext::GroupedGemm`](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipBLASLt/en/latest/reference/ext-reference.html)
API, including per-problem \(m,n,k\), algorithm selection, user arguments, and
workspace.

This is an XLA library custom call, not XLA FFI. Transformer Engine now contains JAX
MoE code, but the MaxText path and flags above do not select it. No TE or direct
JAX-AITER training FFI appears in these four expert fixtures. A package being installed
does not change the lowering without a frontend call and a matching custom-call target.

### Changes at the HLO level

The first two real fixtures use 64 BF16 token rows, four experts, width 128, and
capacity 16. Dense masked HLO forms `%dot_general.2` with output
`bf16[64,4,128]`, so every token has an output for every expert. Fixed capacity first
dispatches to `bf16[4,16,128]`, applies the expert `%dot_general.4`, then combines
with `%dot_general.5`.

{% include figure.liquid path="pages/img/pg6/ch6-hlo-moe-dense-fixed.svg" class="img-fluid" zoomable=true alt="Pruned literal HLO for dense-masked and fixed-capacity expert execution with exact dot names and shapes" caption="Real JAX 0.11 `before_optimizations` HLO. Dense masked carries an expert dimension for every token. Fixed capacity carries an expert and capacity dimension through dispatch, expert GEMM, and combine." %}

The ragged pair begins with the same FP16 `jax.lax.ragged_dot` over 64 rows and four
groups. With grouped lowering disabled, optimized HLO expands and masks rows in
`%loop_transpose_fusion`, computes `%gemm_fusion_dot.2` as
`f32[8,64,128]`, and reduces groups with `%loop_reduce_fusion`.

With grouped lowering enabled, the graph becomes one
`custom_call_target="__cublas$lt$groupedMatmul"` consuming tokens, expert weights,
and `s32[4]` group sizes. The result tuple contains `f16[64,128]` plus a 784-byte
workspace.

{% include figure.liquid path="pages/img/pg6/ch6-hlo-moe-ragged-lowerings.svg" class="img-fluid" zoomable=true alt="Pruned literal optimized HLO comparing ragged dot lowered to dense-padded Triton fusions and to a groupedMatmul custom call" caption="Real JAX 0.11 gfx950 optimized HLO. The frontend operation is the same; the XLA flag changes its backend lowering. Exact operation names and shapes are retained." %}

These fixtures isolate expert execution. They do not include the full Mixtral router,
ragged AllToAll, three expert projections, rematerialization, or backward. For a model
run, verify all of those in the optimized training HLO and identify the final library
kernel in a device trace.

### Case study: Mixtral 8x22B

The study model has 56 layers, width 6144, expert width 16384, eight experts, and
top-2 routing. Sequence length is 4096, local batch is 4, and two gradient
accumulation microsteps produce 262,144 input tokens per eight-GPU update. The current
recipe uses Transformer Engine attention, scanned layers, and
`remat_policy=save_dot_with_context_except_mlp`.

These measurements should be interpreted as integration checkpoints rather
than controlled kernel comparisons. The rows come from separate captures, so
the step times are not a comparison of the two meshes:

| Mesh and expert path | Measured step | Tokens/s/GPU | Compiled memory |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FSDP-1 / EP-8, BF16 fixed capacity | 8.354 s | 3,922.4 | 220.0 GiB/GPU |
| FSDP-4 / EP-2, BF16 fixed capacity | 20.599 s | 1,590.7 | not recorded |

Both rows show that the 140.63-billion-parameter model and fixed-capacity mesh can
complete an update on eight MI355X GPUs. They do not compare ragged dense-padded with
GroupedGEMM. The current v26.6 scripts define that matched FP16 pair with identical
router, EP-8 mesh, worst-case ragged buffer, and AllToAll flags; only
`--xla_gpu_experimental_use_ragged_dot_grouped_gemm` changes. Full 30-step timing,
router histograms, drop counts, optimized full-model HLO, grouped-kernel traces, and
exposed collective time remain the current integration work.

## Applying the configuration sequence

The central lesson of the book is that optimization decisions are
hierarchical.

`precision` → sharding → memory policy → kernel selection.

1. Choose the numeric recipe and optimizer-state dtypes.
2. Choose a mesh that makes persistent state fit and record each GPU's local
   \(B,S,D,F\) shapes.
3. Estimate saved activations at those local shapes, then measure `none`, one named
   policy, and `full`. Keep collectives outside remat boundaries when the program
   permits it.
4. Select attention with separate forward and backward verification. Use HLO for the
   compiler boundary, a kernel trace for the implementation, and clean timing for the
   result.
5. For MoE, decide dropping and padding semantics before choosing a kernel. After
   `ragged_dot`, verify whether optimized HLO contains dense-padded work or the
   hipBLASLt grouped call.
6. Run PMCs only after a trace identifies the question. Counter collection explains
   MFMA and memory traffic; its serialized duration is not training throughput.

For the measured Llama shape, the remat sweep selects `minimal_with_context`, and
the retained clean attention subset favors TE/CK-AITER over standard XLA while
preserving substantial HBM headroom. Mixtral has reached the fixed-capacity stage;
the matched ragged lowering and routing diagnostics are the remaining step before
grouped GEMM can be selected.
